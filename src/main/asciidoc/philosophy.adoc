Testatoo is a strongly opinionated tool. There is no anonymous "WebElement". Everything needs to be a *COMPONENT*.
Testatoo is a strongly typed UI component tool.

In the previous sample the line:
[source, java]
-----------------------------------------------------
InputTypeText search = $('#lst-ib') as InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------
expressed that we try to find an *HTML5 input of type text with id: 'lst-ib'* => <input type="text"/>

The associated import is :
[source, java]
-----------------------------------------------------
import org.testatoo.bundle.html5.input.InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testatoo provides by default the *HTML5* bundle to interact with basic HTML5 components
====

Actually with the usage you will never use the component as an InputTypeText but through its abstraction.
In this case, it was a TextField.
